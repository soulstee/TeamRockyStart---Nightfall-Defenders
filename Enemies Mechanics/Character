Once Ghosts reached at the tower it launches basic melee attacks.
Werewolves - Enables the ability to do ranged attacks to whatever is in close contact first either walls or tower. 
The ranged attack of the werewolve would be blowing wind (Like in the story "Three Little Pigs")

(Ranged attack only affects in a single lane that the werewolve is positioned in)
